#Image transformation

Objectives

1. The general form of the log transformation function is s=T(r)=c*log(1+r), where 's' and 'r'
are the output and input pixel values, and 'c' is the scaling constant. Implement log
transformation and power law transformation. Use the image (fourierspectrum.pgm)
to test the algorithms. Describe the similarity/difference between log transformation
and power-law transformation.

2. Apply histogram equalization to grayscale images with contrast issues. Draw the
histogram of the input and output images. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of
the input and output images and visualize it using a graph 

Technologies used: Python, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pillow, Pytorch
