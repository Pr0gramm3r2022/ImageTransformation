1. The general form of the log transformation function is s=T(r)=c*log(1+r), where 's' and 'r'
are the output and input pixel values, and 'c' is the scaling constant. Implement log
transformation and power law transformation. Use the image (fourierspectrum.pgm)
to test the algorithms. Comment on the similarity/difference between log transformation
and power-law transformation.
2. Apply the histogram equalization to grayscale images with contrast issues. Draw the
histogram of the input and output images. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of
the input and output images.

Technologies used: Python, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pillow, Pytorch
